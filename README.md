Hi, 

Scotty here. This is my first semi-completed project. there are two main files
to choose from. They both use the same wordle_words.py file to grab the list from.

FILE DESCRIPTION - wordle_simulator.py

this is a python console program that will pick a random word from the wordle_words
list and prompt you to guess words, it will give you feedback on how you did and 
show you what letters are not in the word and the letters that are in the word.

PS: it is NOT fully debuged so you will find bugs but i emplore you to try and 
fix these bugs and create a push request. The main logic works fine but not 
perfect.

FILE DESCRIPTION - wordle_helper_Variant1.py

this will act as an assistant for everydays wordle. to use it, you can visit
the website " https://wordleunlimited.org/ " and it will ask you to provide the color of every letter of your guess. 
it will then sort through the list of words, and filter out any outliars. hopefully this will help you guess more effectively
as you play.
